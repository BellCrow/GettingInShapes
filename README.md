# GettingInShapes
Will be a very basic suit to render shapes (or more) in Win/DirectX C++

Ill mostly work with the tutorial from a youtuber called "ChiliTomatoNoodle"

His channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsyHonfwHi4fLb2lkq0DEAA

He makes funny educational videos about C++ and programming in general.
